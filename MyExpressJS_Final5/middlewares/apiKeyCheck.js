// Middleware functions are functions that have access to the request object (req), the response object (res), 
// and the next middleware function in the applicationâ€™s request-response cycle. The next middleware 
// function is commonly denoted by a variable named next.

// * As name suggests it comes in middle of something and that is request and response cycle
// * Middleware has access to request and response object
// * Middleware has access to next function of request-response life cycle

// Image describing the middleware: https://miro.medium.com/max/1400/1*wIkLR_9twvmG-LitHYoftw.png

// Middleware functions can perform the following tasks:

// * Execute any code.
// * Make changes to the request and the response objects.
// * End the request-response cycle.
// * Call the next middleware in the stack.

// Note: If the current middleware function does not end the request-response cycle, it must call next() 
//       to pass control to the next middleware function. Otherwise, the request will be left hanging.

// Types of express middleware
// 1. Application level middleware app.use
// 2. Router level middleware router.use
// 3. Route level (for single route)
// 4. Built-in middleware express.static,express.json,express.urlencoded
// 5. Error handling middleware app.use(err,req,res,next)
// 6. Thirdparty middleware bodyparser,cookieparser which we install through npm
